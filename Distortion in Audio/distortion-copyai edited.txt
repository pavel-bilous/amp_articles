Have you ever experienced distortion while listening to your favorite music? Specifically, high-frequency distortion that alters the clarity and nuance of the sound? In this article, we will explore the technicalities of audio distortion and how it affects the quality of sound reproduction.

Distortion in the audio signal can introduce several unpleasant effects, including loss of clarity, a harsh and artificial quality, and fatigue for the listener's ears. The distortion can even alter the timbre of instruments and vocals while flattening the overall spatial characteristics, making it less vivid and three-dimensional.

Although many modern amplifiers can achieve low distortion of just 0.001% at 1 kHz, challenges arise when the performance is extended to higher frequencies. Distortion levels can rise as high as 0.1% or more at frequencies like 2, 4, 8, 16, and 20 kHz. Amplifiers have their sonic signature shaped by this discrepancy in distortion levels across the frequency spectrum.

It is imperative to assess amplifiers' performance on a broad range of audio signals to evaluate their distortion characteristics not only at 1 kHz but also at higher frequencies. The threshold of audibility for Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) may vary among individuals, but THD levels below 1% are generally inaudible for most listeners.

In high-quality audio systems, efforts are made to minimize THD below 1% to preserve the fidelity of the original audio signal. In the professional setting, audio components aim to keep THD levels much lower, often reaching values well below 0.1% or even 0.0001%.

However, THD is not the only factor to consider in distortion. Intermodulation Distortion (IMD) and Transient Intermodulation Distortion (TIM) contribute to the overall audio quality perception.

IMD occurs when two or more different frequencies interact, creating sum and difference frequencies that can introduce unwanted harmonics. In nonlinear systems, IMD can affect the fidelity of reproduced sound by introducing artifacts that were not part of the original signal.

On the other hand, TIM occurs in amplifiers when handling transient signals. Transients are sudden changes in amplitude, occurring with the attack or decay of musical notes. TIM characterized by intermodulation product creation during the transient period can introduce undesirable artifacts or distortion. Improving the transient response and reducing nonlinearities in the signal path can minimize TIM.

In conclusion, distortion in the audio signal can alter the quality of sound reproduction, affecting the clarity, timbre, and spatial characteristics of music. Low THD, IMD, and TIM values are desirable in high-quality audio systems, aiming to preserve the fidelity of the original audio signal and ensure a clean and accurate sound reproduction.
